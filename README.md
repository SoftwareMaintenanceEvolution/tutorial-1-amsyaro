# Introduction

Hi! I am Mohamad Nor Amsyar, a final year student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course. I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I love hiking and getting involved in nature activities. Since I was a kid, I have been into hiking together with my family.
- **Course expectations**: I am excited to get hands-on experience with maintaining real-world software projects, preparing for future roles in the industry
